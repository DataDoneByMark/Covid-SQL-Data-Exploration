This was an SQL data exploration project performed in SSMS (SQL Server Managaement Studio) on a data set from ourworldindata.org

Analysis results include but are not limited to:
Comparing total cases to total deaths by region.
Mapping out infection percentages as total cases vs total population by region.
Mapping out death rates as new deaths vs new infections by region.
Generating a rolling new vaccination total by region and date.
Creating a View from the analysis to use in visualizations.

SQL techniques used to work the data:
Creating a new database in SSMS
Creating tables within that database.
Changing data types of various fields with CONVERT and CAST functions.
Coding around inaccuracies and errors in the desired results with Where, Like, and Is Not Null clauses along with the NullIf function.
Performing table Joins for more complete results.
